reblog is a short python script for reposting material from a
syndication feed to a site that supports the MetaWeblog API. It
depends on having the Universal Feed Parser[1] installed, and
is more of a quick hack than an industrial-strength tool.

The most interesting use case is importing a linklog, Twitter
feed, or tumblelog into a regular weblog. (I wrote it so I
could import my old linklog into my regular weblog. [2])

I maintain that it is almost too simple to be copyrightable,
but I license it to you under the terms of the GNU GPL.[3]
